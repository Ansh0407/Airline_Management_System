# Airline_Management_System

Topic Description and Functionality:
In our airline management system, we want to implement a reservation system for passengers. Passengers should be able to view available flights, choose a flight, and make reservations. The system should also keep track of reservations and available seats. We also integrated admin module where after logging in as an admin, flights can be added, flight status of existing flights can be changed, passenger booking can be cancelled and passengers’ information as per the flight can also be accessed by the admin.
